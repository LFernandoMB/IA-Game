## üìÑ About the Project
The objective of the project was to practice and learn more about the practice of developing games with Python, the target was to recreate the game "Flappy Bird" by changing the main character of the game and putting a new character.
The objective of the game is to make the character go through the obstacles without being hit, and the control mechanism is just the "Space" key on the keyboard.
Some important concepts were put into practice in this project, such as:
- Use a new library (PyGame)
- Learn and put into practice game development concepts
- Use Object Orientation concepts

The project will have one last implementation, which will train an Artificial Intelligence to play the game.
